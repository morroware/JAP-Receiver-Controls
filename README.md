## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your web server's document root:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jap-receiver-controls.git
   ```

2. Configure your web server to serve the project directory.

3. Copy `config.php.example` to `config.php` and update the settings:
   ```php
   const RECEIVERS = [
       "Rink Music" => "192.168.8.15",
       "Rink Video" => "192.168.8.22",
       // Add more receivers as needed
   ];

   const HOME_URL = 'http://your-home-page-url.com';
   ```

4. Ensure the `log` directory is writable by your web server.

5. Access the interface through your web browser.

## Usage

1. **Accessing the Interface**: Navigate to the URL where you've installed the JAP Receiver Controls.

2. **Controlling Receivers**: 
   - Each receiver is represented by a card on the interface.
   - Select the desired channel from the dropdown menu.
   - Adjust the volume using the slider (if supported by the receiver).
   - Click "Update" to apply the changes.

3. **Viewing Feedback**: After each action, a message will appear at the bottom of the page indicating success or failure.

4. **Returning Home**: Use the "Home" button at the bottom of the page to return to your main control panel or homepage.

## Configuration

The `config.php` file contains several important settings:

- `RECEIVERS`: An array of receiver names and their IP addresses.
- `MAX_VOLUME` and `MIN_VOLUME`: Set the volume range for receivers.
- `MAX_CHANNELS`: The maximum number of channels available.
- `HOME_URL`: The URL of your home page or main control panel.
- `LOG_FILE` and `LOG_LEVEL`: Configure logging behavior.
- `API_TIMEOUT`: Set the timeout for API calls to receivers.
- `VOLUME_CONTROL_MODELS`: List of receiver models that support volume control.

## Troubleshooting

- **Receiver Not Responding**: Ensure the IP address is correct in `config.php` and the receiver is powered on and connected to the network.
- **Volume Control Not Available**: Check if the receiver model is listed in the `VOLUME_CONTROL_MODELS` array in `config.php`.
- **Error Messages**: Check the log file specified in `config.php` for detailed error information.
